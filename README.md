## 🚀 Deploying to Netlify

1. Push the repo to Git and connect to Netlify, or drag‑and‑drop the folder in the Netlify UI.
2. Ensure Forms notifications are enabled:
   - Site Settings → Forms → Form notifications → Email → choose `contact-form`.
3. That’s it — works fine on a `*.netlify.app` domain.
